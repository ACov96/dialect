# Defining and using macros

# Basic macro where we use placeholders like arguments
mac HELLO $person {
    print("Hello", $person);
}

HELLO "Alex";
HELLO "Marcus";

# Macros don't evaluate expressions until they've rendered
# all of the statements, so we can do this
mac SET $var TO $val {
    $var = $val;
}

SET x TO 3;
print(x);
